# GNSS Firehose

Design files for a triband wideband GNSS front-end board.  The board can digitizes three 50 MHz RF channels, emits 2-bit IQ samples to gigabit Ethernet (~800 Mbit/s total payload).

Includes schematics and PCB layout for the hardware design, HDL and software for the FPGA.

The board can by used with Peter Monta's python code (https://github.com/pmonta/GNSS-DSP-tools) or with SDRs like GNSS-SDR (https://gnss-sdr.org/).

See the Github Wiki for more detail on how to use the board.

Open-source licensing.
